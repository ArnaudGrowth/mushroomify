Thank you for reaching out "this far"!

Here's a lists of features and hotfix I (and we) will develop for Mushroomify. 
It also include potential evolution of the Mushroomify extension.

Add **all your ideas** to this list so we can make an awesome extension for all fungi lovers (programmers also accepted ðŸ¤©).
You can go craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazy, I like it and life (and programming) is meant to be fun!ðŸ¤ª

*Is there anything you will like to have within mushroomify? Is there anything you'll like to develop?
Is there a perculiar direction you want the project to go (e.g. Mushroomify YouTube)?*


## HotFix

*If you find any issues, please report them*

- **Fetch all the image in the website** (e.g. scroll to bottom) while preventing to trigger infinite scroll. 
> No clue on how to process. Do you have any ideas?

- **Perfect-sized pictures**
 1. Some images and icons doesn't have any width nor height, which display a much bigger mushroom picture. 
 Example: Mushroomifying [Misakey](https://www.misakey.com/)
> No clue on how to process Do you have any ideas?

 2. Some picture are ugly as they are fit, I will remplace with fill to avoid ugly picture ratio.
 
 > I will do it :)



- **Improving the reliability of picture identification**. 

Some website don't have the standard `scr`, `scr-se`t image attribute, which make it harder to change everyhing into ~~pickles~~ mushrooms.

- Example:
    - [Le monde]([https://www.lemonde.fr/](https://www.lemonde.fr/)): has some image with a `data-original` attribute which overwrite the `scrset` attribute.
    - [L'Obs]([https://www.nouvelobs.com/](https://www.nouvelobs.com/))  has some image with a `data-scr` attribute which overwrite the `scrset` attribute.


> No clue on how to process
> How to identify the exceptions and define a general rule *roughly* universally applicable ?

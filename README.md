## Contribution guideline

I'm no programmer, but I still love it. Learning on your own is hard, it took me 1+ hour to create a repo on a particular folder with git...

But I do believe in flexible collaboration üòçüë®‚Äçüíª<br/>
(that's how Human beings - call it homo sapiens - ended on top of the food chain. For good and for bad...). 

**All** collaborations are welcome, from crazyness to even critics. <br/>
Everything is useful, feel free to say what ever you want. 

So what can give sparkles to my heart üíñ: 
- Tips on how to better use git, GitHub
- UI & copy(writing) improvement
- Improvement of the quality of the code:
  - Readability
  - Advices
  - Front enhancement with React or Javascript
- Help on my next features (see [HOTFIX-NEXT_FEATURE.md](https://github.com/ArnaudGrowth/mushroomify/blob/master/HOTFIX-NEXT_FEATURE.md)) and share **any** propositions of what you may like.
- Answer to few of my questions ([HOTFIX-NEXT_FEATURE.md](https://github.com/ArnaudGrowth/mushroomify/blob/master/HOTFIX-NEXT_FEATURE.md))

But also: 
- Sharing beautiful projects, code, or course for beginneer 
- And of course, reaching me out to chat :) Promise I won't bit, even if you ask!

Plus if you need any help on Marketing, Growth, Entrepreneurship, Design, Data Analysis and Behavioural science, feel free to reach me out.<br/>
Of course, I can pitch you a 30-min conference about fungi üçÑ<br/>
[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/consulting-and-growth-hacking/) or to my email: arnaud.growth@gmail.com.

If you're in Lyon, I offer the beer or the Latt√©.

## Contribution guideline

I'm no programmer, but I still love it. Learning on your own is hard, it took me 1+ hour to create a repo on a particular folder with git...

But I do believe in flexible collaboration üòçüë®‚Äçüíª

(that's how Human beings - call it homo sapiens - ended on top of the food chain. For good and for bad...). 

So all collaborations are welcome, even critics are constructive so feel free to say what ever you want. 

So what can give sparkles to my heart: 
- Tips on how to better use git, GitHub
- UI & copy(writing) improvement
- Improvement of the quality of the code
  - readability
  - advices
  - front enhancement with react or Js
- Help on my next features (see XXX;wd) and **any** propositions of what you may like.
- Answer to few of my questions (XXX;WD)

But also: 
- Sharing beautiful projects, code, or course for beginneer 
- And of course, reaching me out to chat :) Promise I won't bit, even if you ask!

Plus if you need any help on Marketing, Growth, Entrepreneurship, Design, Data Analysis and Behavioural science, feel free to reach me out.

If you're in Lyon, I offer the beer or the Latt√©.
